# Text Manipulation

## Concatenation and Appending

```bash
# Concatenate files
cat batman.txt superman.txt > batmanvssuperman.txt

# Append content to a file
cat wonderwoman.txt >> batmanvssuperman.txt


#put standard output of the "ls -A" command to file.txt
ls -A > file.txt

#append standard output of the "cat file2.txt" command to file.txt
cat file2.txt >> file.txt

#Discard stdout of ls command
ls > /dev/null

#pipelining: the output of "ls -A" will be the input to "wc -l" command
ls -A | wc -l

# Print lines 10 to 15 of a file
sed -n '10,15p' file1.txt

# Append lines 10 to 15 of file1.txt to file2.txt
sed -n '10,15p' file1.txt >> file2.txt

#extracting human-readable text from "data.txt" and searching for lines containing the exact string '==' in a case-insensitive manner
strings data.txt | grep -wi '=='

#decoding a Base64-encoded content from "data.txt" and revealing its original form
cat data.txt | base64 --decode

#Create Hex Dump from a File: This will display the hexadecimal representation along with ASCII characters of each byte in "data.txt."
xxd data.txt

#Create Hex Dump and Redirect to a File: Saves the hex dump of "data.txt" to a file named "hexdump.txt."
xxd data.txt > hexdump.txt

#Convert Hex Dump Back to Binary: Takes the hex dump from "hexdump.txt" and converts it back to binary, saving it as "original_data."
xxd -r hexdump.txt > original_data

#first create hexdump of abc.txt and feed it to xxd with -r option to print the orginal binary ouput
xxd abc.txt | xxd -r

#Hex Dump with Line Numbers: Displays hex dump with 8 bytes per line and includes line numbers.
xxd -c 8 data.txt

#Extracts the second field using a pipe (|) as the delimiter.
echo "name|age|gender" | cut -d '|' -f 2

#This extracts the first and third fields from a CSV file where commas (,) are the delimiters.
cut -d ',' -f 1,3 file.csv
```

# Basic File Comparison and Similarities: Difference using diff cmd

```bash
#Basic File Comparison:
diff file1.txt file2.txt

#Unified Diff Format: Provides a unified diff format, which is often easier to read and understand.
diff -u file1.txt file2.txt

#Recursive Directory Comparison:Compares files in "dir1" and "dir2" recursively.
diff -r dir1 dir2

#Ignores whitespace differences in the comparison.
diff -w file1.txt file2.txt

#Creates a patch file containing the differences between the two files.
diff -u file1.txt file2.txt > my_patch.patch

#taking the contents of "data.txt," sorting them, and then keeping only the unique lines.
cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u

#frequencies per line of a txt file
sort abc.txt | uniq -c

#In order to sort the output with the most frequent lines on top, you can do the following
sort abc.txt | uniq -c | sort -nr

#to get only duplicate lines, most frequent first:
sort abc.txt | uniq -cd | sort -nr

#Say, you have two files and you want to get the actual content of the common lines:
#-F treats the patterns as fixed strings, -x matches whole lines, and -f specifies the file with the patterns.
grep -Fxf <(sort abc.txt) <(sort def.txt)

#you can also use comm command to get the same output as well
comm -12 <(sort abc.txt) <(sort def.txt)
```

# Word Count

```bash
# Count lines, words, characters, and bytes in a file
wc -lwmc filename

# Count lines, words, and characters in a file but using pipelining
cat filename | wc -lwmc

# Count lines, words, and characters in all files in the current directory
cat * | wc -lwmc
```

# File Search

```bash
#find binary/source for command
whereis ls


#we want to search a file and want to avoid anything you haven't access to parts of the filesystem
find / -name "index.html" 2>/dev/null
find / -name "index.html" 2>&-


# Find files with a specific name
#here, . is for current directory * is for pattern matching
find . -type f -name abc.txt
find . -type f -name 'm*l.txt'
find . -type f -iname 'p*m*l.*'

# Delete all PDF files in a directory
find . -type f -name "*.pdf" -exec rm -f {} \;

#find: This command is used to search for files and directories in a directory hierarchy.
#.: Specifies the starting directory for the find command. In this case, it starts the search from the current directory.
#-type f: Specifies the type of the found items. In this case, it looks for regular files.
#-name "*.pdf": Filters the search based on the name of the files. Here, it's looking for files with names ending in ".pdf".
#-exec: Executes a command on the files found by find.
#rm -f {}: The command to be executed. It removes files forcefully (-f). {} is a placeholder for each file found by find, and it gets replaced by the actual file names.
#\;: Indicates the end of the -exec command. It needs to be terminated with a semicolon.


# Display the content of all text files
find . -type f -name "*.txt" -exec cat {} \; | wc -lw

#to know which file contains ASCII character that means human readable
find . -type f -exec file {} + | grep ASCII

#to extract many things
find . -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null -exec file {} + | grep ASCII

#find non executable 1033bytes file and contains ASCII characters
find .
	-type f
	-size 1033c
	-not -executable
  2>/dev/null
	-exec file {} +
	| grep ASCII
```

# Searching Patterns

## rg command

```bash
#The rg command is a fast, ripgrep line-oriented search tool that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern.
#You may need to install it

#Searches for the specified pattern in the file.txt file.
rg "pattern" file.txt

#Recursive Search in Current Directory:
rg "pattern"

#Case-Insensitive Search:
rg -i "pattern"

#Search for Whole Words Only:
rg -w "pattern"

#Search for Lines Not Matching a Pattern:
rg -v "pattern"

#Count the Number of Matches:
rg -c "pattern"

#Search for Files Containing the Pattern:
rg -l "pattern"

#Search for a Specific File Type with a pattern:
rg --type md "pattern"

#Search for Multiple Patterns (OR): Searches for lines containing either pattern1 or pattern2.
rg "pattern1|pattern2"

#Search for Multiple Patterns (AND): Searches for lines containing both pattern1 and pattern2.
rg -e "pattern1" -e "pattern2"

#Exclude Files or Directories: Excludes files listed in skip.txt and the directory named exclude_folder from the search.
rg "pattern" --ignore-file=skip.txt --ignore-dir=exclude_folder

```

## Grep commands

```bash
#-o == only matched part will be portrayed
#-i == case insensetive
#-w == only for matched WORD
# Grep command with options
grep -oi 'c' batman.txt | wc -w
grep -owi 'man' batman.txt | wc -w

# Grep with head and tail
head -n 3 superman.txt | grep -o 'o' | wc -w
tail -n 3 superman.txt | grep -o 'o' | wc -w

# Combined Grep
{ grep -ow 'ASUS' batman.txt && grep -owi 'ASUS' superman.txt } | wc -w

#Q. Find the number of the occurences of 'man' in the first seven lines of the superman.txt file.
head -n 7 superman.txt | grep -o 'man' | wc -l

#Q1. Write a command line that can print the frequencies of a string that starts with ‘p’
and ends with ‘t’ in the last 20 lines of abc.txt file and the first seven
lines of pqr.txt file. [Use regex]

{ tail -n 20 abc.txt | grep -oi 'p*t' && head -n 7 superman.txt | grep -o 'p*t'} | wc -w


# Count occurrences in the first seven lines
head -n 7 superman.txt | grep -o 'man' | wc -l

```

# Permissions and Operations

```bash
# Change file permissions
#Permission:: r = read; w = write; x = execute
#Owner's Permission	 group's permission         random users' permission
#     Current:    rwx rwx rwx
#                 111 111 111
#      After:      -wx r-x ---
#		  011 101 000
chmod 350 filename

#      After:      rwx r-x ---
#		  111 101 000
chmod 750 filename

#recursively change on all subdirectories as well
chmod -R 744 folderName

#to give all permission
chmod +x script.sh

#Grants read (r) and write (w) permissions to the owner (u) of the directory.
chmod -R u+rw folder

#Remove read write and execute bits for "other" and "group" on all files in folder
chmod -R og-rwx

# Give other and group the same rights as user, but removing writing rights.
chmod -R og=u-w folder

#Sticky Bit (t): When the sticky bit is set on a directory, only the owner of a file within that directory can delete or rename the file. It's commonly used on directories like /tmp to prevent users from deleting or modifying each other's files.
#Represented by a lowercase "t" in the "others" permission of the directory.
chmod +t directory

#setting the sticky bit on a directory for others (everyone else, not the owner).after running this command, the sticky bit will be set for others on the specified directory.
chmod o+t folder

#Setuid (s) and Setgid (s) Bits:
#Setuid (s) and setgid (s) are special permissions that can be set on executable files.
#Setuid: When set on an executable file, it runs with the privileges of the file owner.
#Setgid: When set on an executable file, it runs with the privileges of the group owner of the file.
#Represented by an uppercase "S" (if the corresponding execute bit is not set) or "s" (if the execute bit is set).
chmod u+s executable_file   # Setuid
chmod g+s executable_file   # Setgid
```

## Find & Replace with Sed

```bash
# Basic find and replace
sed 's/unix/linux/' geekfile.txt
#Here the “s” specifies the substitution operation. The “/” are delimiters. The “unix” is the search pattern and the “linux” is the replacement string.
#By default, the sed command replaces the first occurrence of the pattern in each line and it won’t replace the second, third…occurrence in the line.

# Replace second occurrence
sed 's/unix/linux/2' geekfile.txt

# Global replacement
sed 's/unix/linux/g' geekfile.txt

# Replace on a specific line number
sed '3 s/unix/linux/' geekfile.txt

#Replacing string on a range of lines :
sed '1,3 s/unix/linux/' geekfile.txt

#Here $ indicates the last line in the file.
sed '2,$ s/unix/linux/' geekfile.txt
```

## Deletion with sed

```bash
# Delete a specific line
sed '5d' filename.txt

# Delete the last line
sed '$d' filename.txt

# Delete lines in a range
sed '3,6d' filename.txt

# Delete from nth to last line
sed '12,$d' filename.txt

# Delete pattern matching line
sed '/abc/d' filename.txt
```
